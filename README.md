# Business Site

This project was made on third week for Technigo bootcamp.
The aim of this week was to create a responsive business site with a hero image/video, signup form that would post data to a HTTPBin service and an accordion (FAQ) that can collapse to show and hide text. 

## The problem

I am really proud of a hero video and how the website looks like with the first touches of Javascript. For this project I used Flexbox, CSS Entities information for accordion icon, made my own logo and found out more about ::after selector. 
The biggest problem I had was the hero video and its responsiveness on mobile. I found out about playsinline property for the video tag to be able to start the video on mobile version.
